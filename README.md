# Docker runner 

Run your integrated test and binaries in multiple docker but with all of their codes written in a single file.

## Note

- Greatly inspired by [super_orchestrator](https://github.com/AaronKutch/super_orchestrator)
- Only supports Linux for now with `musl` compilation target.


## Roadmap
- [x] container network
- [x] async bootstrapping
- [ ] stdin/out dashboard
